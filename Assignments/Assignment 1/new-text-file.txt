Brown Thomas and Arnotts (BTA) are too Irish companies, operating 7 physical shops, which were purchased by the Selfridges Group in 2014. BT&A sell quality brands and host class events which're some craic for shopaholics, but their stores are a teensy bit extravagent (at least in my friend Thomas's opibion).
